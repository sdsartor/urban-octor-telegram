# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Description

This website was created in order to fix an issue with deployment of another website.  It contains photos that talk about marketing, optimization, and management.

## Installation

To create this website, the file had to be added to the local repository and the HTML file needed to be pulled out of the develop folder as well as the assets.  This would place the two files to be on the same branch and remove the separation making the CSS file readable by git pages.
